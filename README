pystatgrab README
http://www.i-scream.org/pystatgrab/

pystatgrab contains python bindings for libstatgrab. For information
on libstatgrab see the libstatgrab website given above.

There is currently very little documentation for pystatgrab.
Installation is a normal distutils setup:

./setup.py install

If the installer has problems finding libstatgrab you may need to set
PKG_CONFIG_PATH to <prefix>/lib/pkgconfig - where prefix is the prefix
you used when installing libstatgrab (default is /usr/local).

The functions available through pystatgrab directly match those of
the libstatgrab functions. Documentation on those functions can be
found in the libstatgrab package, or on the libstatgrab website.

The return types of the functions are dictionaries, sometimes
contained within an array if more than one item is being returned.
These map pretty much directly on to the C structures returned by
libstatgrab.

If you have any problems or find a bug, please let us know. We have
information on how to do that on our website:
